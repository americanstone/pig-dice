Go supports first class functions, higher-order functions, user-defined function types,
 function literals, closures, and multiple return values.

This rich feature set supports a functional programming style in a strongly typed language.

In this codewalk we will look at a simple program that simulates a dice game called Pig
and evaluates basic strategies.
*/

/*
Game overview
Pig is a two-player game played with a 6-sided die. Each turn, you may roll or stay.
If you roll a 1, you lose all points for your turn and play passes to your opponent. Any other roll adds its value to your turn score.
If you stay, your turn score is added to your total score, and play passes to your opponent.
The first person to reach 100 total points wins.

The score type stores the scores of the current and opposing players, in addition to the points accumulated during the current turn.

User-defined function types
In Go, functions can be passed around just like any other value. A function's type signature describes the types of its arguments and return values.

The action type is a function that takes a score and returns the resulting score and whether the current turn is over.

If the turn is over, the player and opponent fields in the resulting score should be swapped, as it is now the other player's turn.
